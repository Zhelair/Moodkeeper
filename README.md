# Moodkeeper

Moodkeeper is a local-first wellbeing notebook: mood, notes, calm tools, alcohol log, weekly goals, and lightweight insights.

## Privacy
- No accounts, no servers.
- Your data is stored on this device (browser storage).
- Optional passphrase adds a local lock and encrypts stored entries/weeks.

## v1.2 (One-bundle)
- Notebook-style UI (Calm Morning default)
- Theme switcher: Calm Morning / Warm Notebook / Dark
- Check-in redesign (mood highlight + persistence)
- Alcohol redesign (neutral logging + “wait 10 minutes”)
- Calm redesign (one-minute grounding + 3/8 min body scan)
- Goals redesign (weekly only, “good enough week”, carry-forward)
- Security: local passphrase lock + auto-lock options + unlock screen
